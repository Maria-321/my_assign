            <p>4. yes it does. 
                In responsive designs, relative units like the em or rem units gives us adaptability and flexibility right out of the box that allows for sizes to be based on the font size(s) defined higher up in the markup. 
                em units for the font-size property will be relative to the font-size of the parent element. em units on other properties than font-size will be relative to the font-size of the current element. rem units sizes will always be relative to the font-size of the root html element.

                    200px means there are 200 minute areas of illumination on a display screen. Resolution of an image can be described using pixels per inch. A 200 × 200 pixel image printed in a inch square has a resolution of 200 pixels per inch.
                    The browser interprets as follows:
                    1.	First, the browser reads the starting image tag, which indicates the browser should display an image on the webpage.
                    2.	The src=”logo.png” attribute and value identify the name of the image to display.
                    3.	The alt=”company logo” attribute and value identify the alternate text to display if the browser cannot display the image.
                    4.	The height=”125”attribute and value reserve the height needed to display the image in the browser.
                    5.	The width=”200”attribute and value reserve the width needed to display the image in a browser, and the right angle bracket (>) closes the image element.

                <p>6.	Specific changes in css3
                    #1. CSS3 Selectors
                    Selectors are at the heart of CSS. Originally, CSS allowed the matching of elements by type, class, and/or ID. CSS2.1 added pseudo-elements, pseudo-classes, and combinators. With CSS3, we can target almost any element on the page with a wide range of selectors.
                    CSS2 introduced several attribute selectors. These allow for matching elements based on their attributes. CSS3 expands upon those attribute selectors.Three more attribute selectors were added in CSS3; they allow for substring selection.
                    1.Matches any element E whose attribute attr starts with the value val. In other words, the val matches the beginning of the attribute value.
                    E[attr^=val]
                    eg.          a[href^='http://sales.']{color: teal;}
                    2.Matches any element E whose attribute attr ends in val. In other words, the val matches the end of the attribute value.
                    E[attr$=val]
                    eg.          a[href$='.jsp']{color: purple;}
                    3.Matches any element E whose attribute attr matches val anywhere within the attribute. It is similar to E[attr~=val], except the val can be part of a word.
                    E[attr*=val]  
                    eg.         img[src*='artwork']{
                                        border-color: #C3B087 #FFF #FFF #C3B087;
                                                   }
                    Pseudo-classes
                    It’s likely that you’re already familiar with some of the user interaction pseudo-classes,namely :link, :visited, :hover, :active, and :focus.
                    A few more pseudo-class selectors were added in CSS3. One is the :root selector, which allows designers to point to the root element of a document. In HTML, it would be <html>. Since :root is generic, it allows a designer to select the root element of an XML document without necessarily knowing it’s name. To permit scrollbars when needed in a document, this rule would work.
                    :root{overflow:auto;}
                    As a complement to the :first-child selector, the :last-child was added. With it one can select the last element named of a parent element. For a site with articles contained in <div class=’article’></div> tags, where each has a last paragraph with some information that needs to be uniformly stylized, this rule would change the font for last paragraph of each article.
                    div.article > p:last-child{font-style: italic;}
                    A new user interaction pseudo-class selector was added, the :target selector. To draw the user’s attention to a span of text when the user clicks on a same-page link, a rule like the first line below would work nicely; the link would look like the second line, the highlighted span like the third.
                    span.notice:target{font-size: 2em; font-style: bold;}
                    <a href='#section2'>Section 2</a>
                    <p id='section2'>...</p>
                    A functional notation for selecting specified elements that fail a test has been created. The negation pseudo-class selector, :not can be coupled with almost any other selector that has been implemented. For example to put a border around images that don’t have a border specified, use a rule like this.
                    img:not([border]){border: 1;}
                    #2. CSS3 Colors
                    CSS3 brings with it support for some new ways of describing colours . Prior to CSS3, we almost always declared colours using the hexadecimal format (#FFF, or #FFFFFF for white). It was also possible to declare colours using the rgb() notation, providing either integers (0–255) or percentages.
                    The color keyword list has been extended in the CSS3 color module to include 147 additional keyword colors (that are generally well supported), CSS3 also provides us with a number of other options: HSL, HSLA, and RGBA. The most notable change with these new color types is the ability to declare semitransparent colors.
                    •	RGBA :
                    RGBA works just like RGB, except that it adds a fourth value: alpha, the opacity level or alpha transparency level. The first three values still represent red, green, and blue. For the alpha value, 1 means fully opaque, 0 is fully transparent, and 0.5 is 50% opaque. You can use any number between 0 and 1 inclusively.
                    2. HSL and HSLA
                    HSL stands for hue, saturation, and lightness. Unlike RGB, where you need to manipulate the saturation or brightness of a color by changing all three color values in concert, with HSL you can tweak either just the saturation or the lightness while keeping the same base hue. The syntax for HSL comprises an integer value for hue, and percentage values for saturation and lightness.
                    The hsl( ) declaration accepts three values:
                    — The hue in degrees from 0 to 359. Some examples are: 0 = red, 60 = yellow, 120= green, 180 = cyan, 240 = blue, and 300 = magenta.
